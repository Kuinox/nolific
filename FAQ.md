# Nolific FAQ

**Why did you select the AGPLv3 license?**

I wanted a license that allows anyone to copy and use Nolific, but, if you make changes, those should also be made available to others. Because Nolific is a hosted web app, I wanted this to apply to modified hosted versions, rather than just distributed versions. If you use Nolific, modify it, and host it publicly, you must release your modifications under the same license.
